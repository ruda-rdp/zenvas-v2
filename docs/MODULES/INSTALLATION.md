# App Store & Module Installation

## Installation Flow

### For New Users
1. User registers → Creates organization with default brand
2. Core modules are automatically enabled
3. Business modules can be installed via App Store

### For Existing Users
1. Navigate to **App Store** in sidebar (OWNER only)
2. Browse available modules
3. Click **Install** to add module
4. Module appears in sidebar immediately

## How It Works

### Data Model
```prisma
model Organization {
  // Core apps are always present
  apps String[] @default(["project-os", "human-capital-os"])
  
  // Optional: add modules like "clients", "orders", "leads"
}
```

### Permission Model
- Only **OWNER** role can install/uninstall apps
- Installed apps appear in sidebar navigation
- Users can remove apps anytime without data loss

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/organization/apps
Returns list of installed app IDs for current organization.

### POST /api/organization/apps
Install or uninstall apps.
```json
{
  "appId": "clients",
  "action": "install" | "uninstall"
}
```

## User Experience

### Sidebar Behavior
```
Before Business OS installed:
├── Dashboard
├── Projects  
├── Team
├── Payouts ⚠️
└── App Store 🆕

After installing Clients + Orders:
├── Dashboard
├── Projects
├── Team
├── Clients ✨
├── Orders ✨
├── Payouts
└── App Store
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **No Mode Switching** - No "Solo Mode" or similar concepts. User simply installs modules as needed.

2. **Brand Per User** - Every user has a default personal brand. They can rename it or add more brands.

3. **Backward Compatible** - Existing organizations with data continue working. New modules are additive.

4. **Data Preservation** - Uninstalling a module hides the UI but data remains in database.
